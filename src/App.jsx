After a disagreement, the King challenged the Queen to bring Lord Rama to Orchha. The Queen undertook a rigorous penance in Ayodhya, and Lord Rama appeared to her as a child, agreeing to come to Orchha under three conditions: He would travel only in Pushya Nakshatra, He would be the king of Orchha, and He would reside permanently wherever He was first placed. Upon returning to Orchha, the Queen, tired from her journey, temporarily placed the idol in her palace. When she later tried to move it to the newly constructed Chaturbhuj Temple, the idol refused to budge, fulfilling Lord Rama's third condition. Thus, the palace itself became the Ram Raja Temple, and Lord Rama was declared the King of Orchha.",

In Indian culture, temples are spiritual gateways between the physical and the cosmic realms. Each temple is constructed based on cosmic geometry (Vastu Shastra) and acts like a transmitter of divine vibrations. The inner sanctum (Garbhagriha) holds the energy of the deity, and the temple layout mirrors the human body and universe symbolizing unity between the soul and the cosmos. Temples are places for prayer, meditation, healing, cultural learning, and spiritual growth. They are spaces where devotion (Bhakti) and energy (Shakti) converge."

            title: "History of Temples",
            text: "The history of Indian temples dates back over two millennia, with references in Vedas, Puranas, and ancient scripts. The earliest temples were simple shrines, often carved into rocks or caves, like the Elephanta and Ajanta caves. As time progressed, dynasties like the Guptas, Cholas, Pallavas, Rashtrakutas, and Hoysalas began constructing large stone temples with intricate carvings, towers (shikaras), and monumental gateways (gopurams). These temples were not only religious centers but also cultural hubs — where music, dance, astronomy, Ayurveda, and education were practiced. Temples became central to community life, preserving traditions and transmitting spiritual wisdom across generations."
          },
          {
            title: "Origin of Temples",
            text: "Temples originated from the desire of sages and kings to anchor divine energy on Earth. In ancient India, rishis (sages) meditated in forests and remote hills, identifying sacred energy points known as Kshetras. These locations were chosen based on planetary alignments, natural energy fields, water flows, and cosmic resonance. Once identified, a temple would be consecrated using Vedic rituals, aligning it with both earthly and celestial elements. Many temples are located near rivers, on hilltops, or where mythological events occurred — signifying their divine origin. The idea was to create a permanent space where humanity could connect with the divine anytime."
          },
          {
            title: "Establishment of Temples",
            text: "The process of establishing a temple is known as Pratishtha Vidhi and is performed with utmost spiritual discipline. It starts with Bhoomi Pooja (worship of the land), followed by laying the foundation aligned with Vastu Purusha Mandala — the divine architectural blueprint. The temple structure is built with mathematical precision, using principles from Vastu Shastra and Agama Shastra, ensuring harmony with nature and the cosmos. The idol (murti) is sculpted under strict rituals, and life is invoked into it using Prana Pratistha — where the deity is spiritually installed into the sanctum. Only after this consecration is the temple considered spiritually active — capable of healing, blessing, and guiding the devotee’s soul toward moksha (liberation). The bells, lamps, chants, and rituals are all designed to awaken the senses and spirit."

The earliest temples were simple shrines, often carved into rocks or caves, like the Elephanta and Ajanta caves. As time progressed, dynasties like the Guptas, Cholas, Pallavas, Rashtrakutas, and Hoysalas began constructing large stone temples with intricate carvings, towers (shikaras), and monumental gateways (gopurams). These temples were not only religious centers but also cultural hubs — where music, dance, astronomy, Ayurveda, and education were practiced. Temples became central to community life, preserving traditions and transmitting spiritual wisdom across generations.";
